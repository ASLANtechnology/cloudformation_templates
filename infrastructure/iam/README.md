# IAM CloudFormation Templates

## Purpose

IAM Policies

## Running from the Command Line

Refer to [How do I use an MFA token to authenticate access to my AWS resources through the AWS CLI?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/authenticate-mfa-cli/)

Here's an example:

```aws sts get-session-token --serial-number arn-of-the-mfa-device --token-code code-from-token```

It might look like this (where `123456789012` is your AWS account id, `USERNAME` is your IAM username, and `123456` is the 6-digit code provided by your MFA device):

```aws sts get-session-token --serial-number arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/USERNAME --token-code 123456```

You get the full ARN for serial-number by going to the specific user and selecting Security Credentials and then copying the value from the *Assigned MFA device* field

You'll get a response like this: 

```{
"Credentials": {
    "SecretAccessKey": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
    "SessionToken": "AQoDYXdzEJr...<remainder of security token>",
    "Expiration": "2018-10-11T10:09:50Z",
    "AccessKeyId": "ASIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
  }
}
```

```sudo vim .aws/credentials```


```
[default]
output = json
region = us-east-1
aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
aws_session_token = AQoDYXdzEJr...<remainder of security token>
```


### Troubleshooting


Incorrect "Permanent" Credentials - when calling `aws sts get-session-token`: 

```An error occurred (InvalidClientTokenId) when calling the GetSessionToken operation: The security token included in the request is invalid.```

When running a command (e.g. in this case, `aws s3 ls`) from the AWS CLI without temporary credentials:

```An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the ListBuckets operation: Access Denied```

When running a `aws sts get-session-token --serial-number arn-of-the-mfa-device --token-code code-from-token` command from the AWS CLI using the wrong `--serial-number`: 

```An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the GetSessionToken operation: MultiFactorAuthentication failed, unable to validate MFA code.  Please verify your MFA serial number is valid and associated with this user.```


When entering the wrong MFA six-digit token for the `--serial-number` (e.g. ARN for the user): 

```An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the GetSessionToken operation: MultiFactorAuthentication failed with invalid MFA one time pass code.```

Incorrectly entering temporary session token: 

```An error occurred (InvalidToken) when calling the ListBuckets operation: The provided token is malformed or otherwise invalid.```

Incorrectly entering temporary credentials (e.g. AccessKeyId and/or SecretAccessKey):

```An error occurred (SignatureDoesNotMatch) when calling the ListBuckets operation: The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your key and signing method.```

Missing session token:

```An error occurred (InvalidAccessKeyId) when calling the ListBuckets operation: The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records.```

Attempting to run the `aws sts get-session-token` command when the local credentials contain the session credentials:

```An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the GetSessionToken operation: Cannot call GetSessionToken with session credentials```

When launching a CloudFormation stack from the CLI. Here's an example you might see if access to SQS were denied without MFA: 

```API: sqs:CreateQueue Access to the resource https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ is denied.```

Invalid credentials when calling a specific command (e.g. in this case, `aws s3 ls`): 

```An error occurred (InvalidAccessKeyId) when calling the ListBuckets operation: The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records.```
