# AWS Polly
## Introduction

Using Amazon Polly to create an audio version of a blog post.

# Step 1 - Copy display text from website
Manual: Copy text from website

# Step 2 - Commit to GitHub
Commit to text file in github

# Step 3 - CloudFormation Template
CloudFormation of S3 bucket for storage, IAM Roles, Cloudwatch event notifications, Codebuild, Codepipeline, SNS

# Step 4 - Deployment Pipeline
Pipeline

* **Source**: Github
* **Build**: CodeBuild 

Copies file from Codepipeline input artifact to S3

Run Amazon Polly commands and store Output in S3

# Step 5 - Manual HTML Update

One Time: update Html with audio tag that points to location in S3

# Tips
pip install awscli --upgrade --user (didn't have `start-speech-synthesis-task`)
Use the same file name in S3 so that it can be used as a URL (and make it public)
Add manual approvals for manual tasks such as copying text and updating HTML with the new S3 HTTP URL


# Other Ideas
1. Manually create an Amazon S3 bucket
1. Manually create an Amazon Text-to-Speech MP3 and synthesize to Amazon S3
1. Make the MP3 public
1. Create an HTML audio tag snippet and embed in the blog post (HTML/Wordpress)
1. Create a custom CloudFormation resource
1. The Lambda in the custom CloudFormation resource will using the AWS CLI to create MP3 using Amazon Polly
1. Create a CloudFormation template that creates the S3 bucket, uses the Amazon Polly custom resource, and a CodePipeline that uses Polly every time some text is changed. 
1. @TODO Convert commands from `test.sh` to CodeBuild. Then use GitHub and have CodeBuild copy from GitHub to S3 and download it locally and use with Polly.

New Idea: Use CodeBuild to do the same thing using the AWS CLI?

Question: How to automatically upload text from Wordpress changes to S3 or a version control repo?

## Architecture and Implementation
###  Architecture Diagram
![budgets-arch](docs/budgets-arch.png)

## CloudFormation Templates resources
  - **AWS Budget** – [AWS::Budgets::Budget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-budgets-budget.html) – TBD

## Costs
This section outlines cost considerations for provisioning AWS Budgets Notifications. 
- **CloudFormation** – No Additional Cost

## Deployment Steps
####  Step 1. Prepare an AWS Account
Create or login AWS account at [http://aws.amazon.com](http://aws.amazon.com) by following the instructions on the site.

####  Step 2. Launch the Stack
Click on the **Launch Stack** button below to launch the CloudFormation Stack to set up your AWS Budgets. 

**Stack Assumptions:** The pipeline stack assumes the following conditions, and may not function properly if they are not met:
1. The pipeline stack name is less than 20 characters long
2. The stack is launched in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (`us-east-1`).

*NOTE: The URL for Launch Stack is automatically generated through a pipeline in one of Stelligent's AWS accounts.*

[![Launch CFN stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#cstack=sn~sagemaker-stack|turl~https://s3.amazonaws.com/sagemaker-pipeline-src/CodePipeline/pipeline.yaml)

You can launch the same stack using the AWS CLI. Here's an example:

```
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name YOURSTACKNAME --template-body file:///home/ec2-user/environment/cloudformation_templates/labs/polly/pipeline.yml --parameters ParameterKey=GitHubToken,ParameterValue=GITHUBTOKEN --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

## Parameters
Parameters | Description
---------- | -----------
Currency | Country currency. Default is `USD`.
StartTime | Start Time for the first day in which AWS Budgets is reporting on cost usage.
EndTime | End Time for the last day in which AWS Budgets is reporting on cost usage.
BudgetLimit | Numeric form of budget limit for the evaluated time period. Default is: `1000`. 
SageMakerBudgetLimit | Numeric form of budget limit for a specifc service (`Amazon SageMaker` in this case) for the evaluated time period.
Threshold01 | Number between 0 and 100 representing the percentage of the `BudgetLimit` in which people get notified
Threshold02 | Number between 0 and 100 representing the next percentage of the `BudgetLimit` in which people get notified
EMail01 | Email address for which budget notifications are sent. Example is `example@example.com`.
PhoneNumber01 | Phone number for which budget notifications are sent via SMS. Format is `12125551212`. Number must be preceded by the country code (e.g. USA is `1`)

####  Step 3. Test the Deployment
Go to the [AWS Budgets dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/budgets) and verify the budgets have been created correctly.
