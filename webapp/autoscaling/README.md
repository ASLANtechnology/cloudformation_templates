# Auto Scale Group Behind ELB CloudFormation Template

## Purpose
Create an Autoscaling group in 3 private subnets, an Elastic Load Balancer in 3 public subnets and S3 Logging Bucket.
Setup to use SSL/TLS port 443 on ELB. Plus it updated Route 53 Hosted DNS alias to point to the ELB.

This can be used for a baked AMI webapp for deployment through the AWS Console or CLI tools.

I wrote it to stand up a Mediawiki web server autoscaling group based on baked AMI and a MySQL RDS setup by another template.

It's more of an example than anything. So grab it and customize all you want.


## Requirements
* VPC
* 3 Private Subnets
* 3 Public Subnets
* AMI
